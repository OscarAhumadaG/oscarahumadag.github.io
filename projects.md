## 🎨 1. Cifar10 Image Inpainting with Autoencoders

![CIFAR10 Inpainting](assets/img/cifar10-inpainting.png)  
We used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and an autoencoder architecture with an adversarial approach (*generator vs discriminator*) to recover damaged images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. Built entirely with PyTorch.
